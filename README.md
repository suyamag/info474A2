##Exploratory Data Analysis

I chose a dataset on wine reviews that I found on Kaggle. I've delevoped a taste for certain wines recently so I am curious to learn more about which wines have more value. I am also interested to see if the human palate can distinguish the difference between a "high quality" wine and a cheap wine. I've heard rumors that it is actually difficult to distinguish the difference (which makes snese because taste is subjective).

Initial Question:
Does the price affect the wine's rating?

I created a scatterplot to visualize the points per price to see if there is a positive correlation between the two. While there does apprear to be a positive trend between the two variables, it is also safe to say that there are diminishing returns for the increase in quality to price anywhere beyond about $500



Step 1. Pick a domain that you are interested in.
Some good possibilities might be the physical properties of chemical elements, the types of stars, or the human genome. Feel free to use an example from your own research, but do not pick an example that you already have created visualizations for.
Step 2. Pose an initial question that you would like to answer.
For example: Is there a relationship between melting point and atomic number? Are the brightness and color of stars correlated? Are there different patterns of nucleotides in different regions in human DNA?
Step 3. Assess the fitness of the data for answering your question.
Inspect the data--it is invariably helpful to first look at the raw values. Does the data seem appropriate for answering your question? If not, you may need to start the process over. If so, does the data need to be reformatted or cleaned prior to analysis? Perform any steps necessary to get the data into shape prior to visual analysis.
