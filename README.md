I want to figure out which character has the highest win rate in each role (there are 5 different 


Step 1. Pick a domain that you are interested in.
Some good possibilities might be the physical properties of chemical elements, the types of stars, or the human genome. Feel free to use an example from your own research, but do not pick an example that you already have created visualizations for.
Step 2. Pose an initial question that you would like to answer.
For example: Is there a relationship between melting point and atomic number? Are the brightness and color of stars correlated? Are there different patterns of nucleotides in different regions in human DNA?
Step 3. Assess the fitness of the data for answering your question.
Inspect the data--it is invariably helpful to first look at the raw values. Does the data seem appropriate for answering your question? If not, you may need to start the process over. If so, does the data need to be reformatted or cleaned prior to analysis? Perform any steps necessary to get the data into shape prior to visual analysis.
